# Chess AI

Project Goal: build an unbeatable chess AI
in Java

Project Steps:

    1. Code functional Chess game that can be played between 2 human players
        - Design Graphics
        - Logic for chess moves
        - User input
    2. Code AI that can play a human player at various difficulties (Beg, Int, Adv, etc)
    3. Crank the diffculty up to 1000000/10

Notes
    
    As of 6/23/21 on Step 1. I expect this step to take the longest as I'm building graphics
    and logic for the game from scratch.
